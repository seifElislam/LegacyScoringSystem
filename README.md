# LegacyScoringSystem
a full-stack, cloud-native data pipeline designed to be audited and modernized by experienced engineers. This repository serves as a practical assessment resource for Software Engineer interviews and training.

The system's goal is to ingest large CSV files of customer activity, calculate a final "Value Score," and store the result for real-time access. The challenge for the candidate is to audit the existing system, identify high-priority issues that impact security, scalability, or maintainability, and propose professional, modernized solutions.

## Use Cases for Audit and Modernization

- Code Review & Clean Code: Audit the Python and Java codebases against modern OOP and language-specific standards.

- System Design & Scaling: Propose refactoring the current data ingestion flow into an asynchronous, high-throughput, and scalable architecture.

- DevOps & CI/CD: Design the necessary GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration, quality gates, and zero-downtime deployment for the multi-technology stack.

- Security & IaC Audit: Audit the Terraform configuration for security compliance (IAM, S3 access) and operational excellence.
